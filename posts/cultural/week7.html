				<h1>Exploring My values</h1>
				<p>When I think of the times in my life where I have been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, the following values come to mind:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Community</li>
					<li>Compassion</li>
					<li>Competence</li>
					<li>Cooperation</li>
					<li>Creativity</li>
					<li>Decisiveness</li>
					<li>Dependability</li>
					<li>Enthusiasm</li>
					<li>Helping other people</li>
					<li>Honesty</li>
					<li>Leadership</li>
					<li>Openness</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Among these values <em>community</em> is probably the most important determinant of my own personal happiness. Being part of a community gives me peace of mind as well as greater happiness and motivation. It feels so great when I can bounce ideas off other people, listen to stories I can relate to or that inspires me, and cooperate with others to create a better life for everyone. This has always been the case, but it is even more important now that I am a parent. It really does take a village to raise a child; that is if you want to maintain your sanity!
				</p>
				<p>
					However, while community may be my number one determinate of happiness the other qualities I listed are also very important to me. These additional qualities are what make communities great. A community alone is not necessarily a beneficial addition to my life. That community must also adhere to the same principles that I hold dear, namely the ones listed above, which I strive to achieve to the fullest extent of my abilities every day.

					I don't really see how advice really goes with the theme of this essay so I am putting the answer to that question here in the fade. The last topic I was asked advice on was 'how to raise a child properly'. These questions have ranged from very specific, such as what foods to eat, to more general such as the right mix of support vs. letting child figure something out on their own. These questions have come from my partner and family following the birth of my first son last year.

				<p>
					One of the great things about being part of a community of individuals who all adhere to these qualities is that one of these communities is open and warm, but also filled with energy. Ideas flow freely and new and exciting projects or companies are always popping up which help to spur even greater cooperation, creativity, and enthusiasm. In such a community problems such as stereotype threat or depression are much less prevalent. People are always made to feel welcome and most quickly notice if someone is not engaging the group and therefore requires support. Also, if you are working with like minded individuals on projects of common interest with a common passion many of the typical problems within groups seem less prevalent. If you are happy at work and in life I believe you will be much less judgmental of yourself and others.
