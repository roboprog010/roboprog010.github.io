		<h1>Behance Design Analysis</h1>
		<p>
			Behance solves the problem of organizing, searching, and displaying designer and artist portfolios.  To do this effectively a lot of meta data about each project has to be displayed attractively and succinctly.  I believe they have accomplished this difficulty with the judicious use of filters, views, categories, and buttons while also encouraging others to join the community as well.
