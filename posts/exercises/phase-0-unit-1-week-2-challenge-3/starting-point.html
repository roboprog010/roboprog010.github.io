      <h3>Our Views on Responsive Design</h3>
      <h4>By: Dustin Snyder &amp; Sean Ellis</h4>
      <div class="responsive-design">
        <h5>Responsive Design</h5>
        <p>Responsive design consists of three separate but interrelated principles which includes:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Fluid Grid</li>
              <li>Responsive Images</li>
              <li>Media Queries</li>
          </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="fluid-layouts">
        <h5>Fluid Layouts</h5>
        <p>A fluid layout is a design that is oriented in percentages instead
            hard pixels values which allows a design to scale with the browser.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="your-conclusion">
        <h5>Our Conclusion</h5>
        <p>Responsive design was created in order to address the changing ecosystem 
          of the web in which the number of devices and the format of those devices has increased exponentially. 
          Websites now <em>need</em> to adapt all the way from a 320px by 480px iPhone to a 1800px by 2880px Retina screen.

        <h5>Reflection</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>How was it to implement these concepts?</span>
            <p>Easy, but a lot of fun.  I am sure that once I try making responsive sites work across all browsers it won't be as easy!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?</span>
            <p>Smartphones and tablets have really revolutionized web design.  Before their arrival most websites seem to have been designed for whatever screen size was considered 'safe' and then updated every so often as screens got larger.  With the advent of mobile devices there really is no safe size any more.  Now the focus is on safe content, structure, and functionality which can be delivered to every device.  Then enhancements are added to allow for more functionality depending on each device's detected latency, bandwidth, platform capabilities, screen size and resolution.</p>
            <p>Curious enough technological change led to design change which is leading to a change in how we as developers think about the web.  This will hopefully continue the trend toward greater semantic code, usability, extensibility, and often forgotten accessibility.</p>
          </li> 
          <li>
            <span>How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?</span>
            <p>I would assume that the visually impaired can navigate at least some of the web.  That is websites which are well designed from the inside out with semantic well organized code. Therefore good design and accessibility often work hand in hand which is awesome! However, if this was not the case and I had to consciously choose to add accessibility and it's associated costs I would have a tough decision to make. I would make this decision based on the following questions (in order of importance):
            <ol>
              <li>Does money matter? If it is a personal project instead of a commercial one, or if I was just rich, I would definitely add as much accessibility as was within my experience.</li>
              <li>Are my competitors adding accessibility to their sites?</li>
              <li>Is the government actually enforcing the laws or is it just like collecting state sales taxes all over again</li>
              <li>Does my target market include people with disabilities</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>So basically, if the government actually enforces the law then obviously I would add accessibility.  Even if I did not have to add accessibility by law if all of my competitors, or community if you will, embraced this initiative I would as well since everyone is incurring the same cost in order to achieve something great.</p> 
            <p>However, if the government did not enforce the law and the community as a whole didn't seem to care and people with disabilities were determined to be too small of a segment of my target market to incur the additional cost I would not add any unnecessary accessibility.  This unfortunate result is necessary because adding accessibility under these conditions would put me or my company at a disadvantage in the market place for developing digital products for the web.</p> 
            <p>Something similar has been demonstrated with web business and brick-and-mortar business for years with regards to sales taxes. I am still not sure why the government has decided to give web business such an advantage over traditional brick-and-mortar stores.</p>
          </li> 
          <li>
            <span>What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?</span></li> 
            <p>The idea behind semantic markup, reusable code, and flexible lean designs all resonate very strongly with me. Having made websites in the bad old days of table based layouts and spacer GIFs I can say that I really <em>really</em> love the present and I am super excited to be a part of the future!</p>
            <p>As an aside I am not sure why it takes browsers so long to adapt to standards.  Maybe there is a reason.</p>
